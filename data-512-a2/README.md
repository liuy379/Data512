## Questions
#### 1. "What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?"

#### 2. "What (potential) sources of bias did you discover in the course of your data processing and analysis?"

#### 3. "What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?"

#### 4. "What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?"


#### 5. "Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?"


#### 6. "Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might still be appropriate and useful, despite its inherent limitations and biases?"


#### 7. "How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?"
